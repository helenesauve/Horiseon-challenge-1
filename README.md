# Horiseon: Code Refactor

## Description
 
This repo contains the first challenge of the Front-End Web Developer bootcamp which consists of an on-the-job ticket: a starter code that needs to be modified. The aim of the challenge is to improve the code by making it more **accessibile**. 

Once the code is improved, the result should look like the image below:

In order to make the code more accessible, I have focused on the below:

* Adding semantic HTML elements i.e convey an underlying meaning to the structure of the page by 'sectioning' elements
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Adding `alt` attributes to images and icons
* Ensuring Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
* Consolidating CSS selectors and properties and making sure they are organised to follow semantic structure.
* HTML and CSS files are meaningfully commented


### Resources:

* [Semantic HTML](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/semantic-html/)


### Issues

I have run into the below issues during the challenge:

* Deciding whether images are descriptive or not, therefore need an empty alt attribute or not
* Deciding whether the hero picture should be a `div` or `figure` element
