# Horiseon: Code Refactor

## Description
 
This repo contains the first challenge of the Front-End Web Developer bootcamp which consists of an on-the-job ticket: a starter code that needs to be modified. The aim of the challenge is to improve the code by making it more **accessibile**. 

## Why does accessibility matter?
 
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Once the code is improved, the result should look like the image below.

In order to make the code more accessible, I have focused on the below:

* Adding semantic HTML elements i.e convey an underlying meaning to the structure of the page by 'sectioning' elements
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Adding `alt` attributes to images and icons
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
* Consolidating CSS selectors and properties and making sure they are organised to follow semantic structure.
* HTML and CSS files are meaningfully commented
